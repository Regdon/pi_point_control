Python installed by default on PI.
Need to install RPi.GPIO for these to work.

First need to set up a virtual python environment (venv)
run:
python -m venv venv

Then to activate the venv, first cd to the folder with the venv folder in it, Then
run:
. venv/bin/activate

Now inside venv need to install RPi.GPIO
run:
pip install Rpi.GPIO
