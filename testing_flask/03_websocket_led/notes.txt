Important to note that the GPIO setup must happen before the socketio.run code.
Socketio.run causes the main code to pause at that line, so no further code will run in the main loop.

Add GPIO.cleanup() at the end of the code to ensure when closed the pins are released for next use.

Otherwise this is just a combination of the code from example 1 and 2.
