Needed to setup a few things with ic2 to get this one working:

Install i2c tools:
sudo apt-get install -y i2c-tools

Install smbus for Python (in venv)
pip install smbus

Do some stuff to enable i2c on the pi:

Add to 
sudo nano /boot/config.txt

dtparam=i2c0=on
dtparam=i2c1=on
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=i2c_vc=on

Add to
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
bcm2708.vc_i2c_override=1

Run
sudo modprobe i2c-dev
followed by
lsmod | grep i2c

Add to
sudo nano /etc/modules
i2c-dev

sudo reboot

Use i2cdetect -y 0
to check i2c works and detect attached devices (although Arduino didn't pick up it still worked)

Default pins used in code:
Arduino
SDA - A4
SCL - A5

Pi

SCL - GPIO9

Address used for Arduino slave = 0x08
