Need to ensure that Node JS and NPM are both installed on the PI first:

1) Update stuff:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

2) Add the NodeSource PPA (Personal Package Archive):
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -

3) Install NodeJS and NPM:
sudo apt install nodejs

4) Check they installed correctly:
node -v
npm -v

5) Then need to download the onoff module in NPM:
npm install onoff

This code defaults to blinking an LED connected to GPIO pin 4.

However as of PI 5 the GPIO pins cannot simply be accessed by referencing pin '4'. We need to work out what internal ID is associated with that pin.
Run following command line:
sudo cat /sys/kernal/debug/gpio

Find the section for the GPIO numbered pins. The pin number is in the backets, the actual number used in the code is outside the brackets.
Unsure if this changes from board to board, but certainly does between PI models.
For example to use Pin 4 as per the example, we need to use 575 on the PI 5.

Run the program by navigating to the correct folder (use ls to see a directory listing, then cd ... to move into a directory)
Run the code with the following command:
node blink.js
